In this project we work with basics conpcets of ODL as a IListenDataPacket and create a match table or add flows. The idea is develope a plugin which can install new TCP flows on the switch while achieve be a LOAD BALANCER.

The stage will have 3 hosts (2 servers 1 client) and one switch. We suppose that the Swicht will have a public IP and the client only can send packets to this public IP.
